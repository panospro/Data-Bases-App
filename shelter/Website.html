        <h2>Welcome to Our Animal Shelter!</h2>

        <!-- Create the body of the Home Page -->
        <p>The animal shelter was founded just a few years ago by animal lovers who saw the need for a safe and loving home for abandoned and homeless pets in our community. As a small organization, we started with a handful of dedicated volunteers and one building to house and care for a few dozen animals. Our commitment to improving the lives of animals and promoting human-animal relationships drove us from the beginning.</p>
        <p>After word spread about our mission and dedication, we began to grow. We expanded our services and reach to help more animals in need as more volunteers joined our team. New buildings and programs were built and our small shelter started making a big difference.</p>
        <p>With determination and hard work we managed today to be an important and useful member of society and help several hundreds of animal lives every year.We are always looking for new ways to make a difference and to reach even more animals in need. We are grateful for the support of our donors, volunteers and community partners, who make our work possible and help us to move forward in our mission.</p>

        <h2>Adopt a Pet</h2>
        
        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>Thank you for considering adoption! By adopting a pet from our shelter, you are giving a second chance to a deserving animal and providing them with a loving forever home. All of our animals are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations before they go home with their new families.</p>
        
        <!-- Adoption Process -->
        <h3>Adoption Process</h3>
        <p>Adopting a pet from our shelter is easy! Just follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Browse our available pets and decide which one you would like to adopt</li>
          <li>Contact us to set up a meet and greet with the pet</li>
          <li>Fill out an adoption application and bring it with you to the meet and greet</li>
          <li>If the meet and greet goes well and your application is approved, you can take your new pet home with you that day!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please note that we do require a home visit as part of our adoption process to ensure that the pet is going to a suitable home. We also require a minimum donation to help cover the cost of care for the animal.</p>
